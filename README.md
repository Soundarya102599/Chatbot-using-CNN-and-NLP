# Chatbot-using-CNN-and-NLP
Built a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot is trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses.Recurrent neural network (LSTM) is used to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then a random response is given from the list of responses.The dataset used is ‘intents.json’. This is a JSON file that contains the patterns which is to be found and the responses is returned to the user.The implementation is as follows:Import and loaded the data file.The data file is in JSON format and so the json package is used to parse the JSON file into Python.Then,preprocessed the data:Iterated through the patterns , tokenized the sentence and lemmatized each word and removed duplicate words from the list.Then,created the training and testing data.Then,built the model and finally predicted the response.Also,Developed a graphical user interface.Tkinter library which is  is shipped with tons of useful libraries for GUI.The input message from the user are taken and then used the helper functions to get the response from the bot and it is displayed on the GUI.
